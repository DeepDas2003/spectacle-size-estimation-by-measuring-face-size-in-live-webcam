In this project I have used mediapipe to gather facial landmarks and I have used the formula to calculate the distance of face height and temple height by utilising landmarks. As model fails to generate the appropriate face size due in random distance due to change in pixel size at first I have measured a real world object after that I have implemented in it via unitary method. in this case machine learning meets math in order to fix the real face shape. 
 After that I have used scikit learn model to estimate the size of spectacle from human face size. and even I have implemented lenskart web browser so that it starts filtering automatically in web browser using the prediction to find my fit sized spectacle
